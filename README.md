# Exploration
Tasks:
1. A 2-D tracking rover is developed using the Simultion tool V-REP.
2. This simulation tool fitted with a Proximity sensor can roam freely  in a rectangular room, guided with predefined velocity.
3. A simulation script is developed that can track the odometric data of the wheel movement and thereby estimating the current positon.
4. The linear movement is checked against the exact value and the results are acceptable.
5. Care should be taken to estimate the turning movements and the corresponding odometric position estimation.


Note: To run the simulation model, non limited educational version of V-Rep software from Coppelia Robotics is required. The download executable can be found at http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/downloads.html
